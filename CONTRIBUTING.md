reflectui is an open source project inviting others to contribute. 
Thanks for considering!
	
Please note that reflectui aims to be simple and minimalistic, with as little to configure as possible.  

If you'd like to remove or simplify code, fix bugs, add tests or improve code, PRs and issues are welcome.
	
However, if you'd like to add new functionality that increases complexity or scope, please make an issue and discuss your proposal first. 

Finally, please respect that reflectui, as a side project, has only limited available resources.

Thank you!
